What is this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a rewrite of commonly used munin plugins in C as a single binary.
The purpose is reducing resource usage:
 * disk space: the binary is smaler than the plugins together
 * more diskspace: it has no dependencies on other programs
 * less forks: it does not fork internally
 * faster startup: it doesn't start perl or shell
 * less memory: just a small C program
 * less file accesses: one binary for many plugins
This can be useful for machines with restricted resources like embedded
machines.

What plugins are included?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cpu entropy forks fw_packets interrupts load open_files open_inodes
processes swap uptime

Disadvantages?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You lose flexibility. You can no longer just edit the plugin and if you try
you have to be very careful not to break it. If you want to deploy this you
have to create one binary for each architecture.

How to use?
~~~~~~~~~~~
After compiling there will be binary munin-plugins-busybox. You can just
replace symlinks in /etc/munin/plugins/ with symlinks to this binary.
