This is a rewrite of munin node in C.

Pro:
----

The purpose is multiple:

 * reducing resource usage for embedded plateforms, specially when paired
   with the C rewrite of the core plugins.

 * no need for Perl

 * Everything runs from inetd.

Cons:
-----

 * You lose flexibility

      It is compiled code, so you have to create binaries.  Even one for each
      architecture.

 * Not all the features are implemented

     - root uid is not supported. All plugins are run with a single user, usually nobody.
     - no socket is opened. Everything runs from inetd.
