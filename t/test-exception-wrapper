# Parameters:  SHELL_DIALECT  SCRIPT_FILENAME

# See EXPECTED_FAILURES_LIST_FILENAME for the filename pattern of a file, containing the relative
# names of all scripts, that are expected to fail.  This wrapper script will fail, if the exit
# status of the test does not match the expectated result (i.e. it fails but should pass or it
# passes while being listed in the EXPECTED_FAILURES_LIST_FILENAME file).
