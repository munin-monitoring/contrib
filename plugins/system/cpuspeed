# Munin-plugin to monitor the CPU temperature using mbmon
#
# Used the plugin-frame from "cpuload" by Bjørn Ruberg, published under the GNU GPL
#
# Plugin monitors the cpu-frequency for both cores of my AMD 64-X2-3600+. Works fine running Debian
# GNU/Linux 4.0 (Etch). I do not know any perl and will not proceed in developing this plugin any further.
# If you wish to, feel free to do so yourself. If I am able to, I will help with any problems, contact me
# via Mail (x-stars <at> gmx.de) or through the Debian-German-User-Mailing-List.
