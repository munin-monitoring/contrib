# HugePages monitoring plugin for munin
#
# This plugin monitors the usage of the Linux kernel HugePages, on some
# architectures also called  Large Pages. It will show both pre-reserved
# pages (via /prc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages), their usage and reserved size, as
# well as HugePages allocated by the khugepaged (activated by the
# transparent_hugepages kernel command line parameter). All values are
# shown in (KiBi/MeBi/GiBi)Bytes.
#
# This plugin is used like many other munin plugins: put it in 
# /usr/share/munin/plugins (or another appropriate location)
# and create a symlink in /etc/munin/plugins:
# > ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/hugepages /etc/munin/plugins
# Then restart munin-node.
