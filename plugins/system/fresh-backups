=head1 NAME

fresh-backups - Plugin to monitor the freshness of backup files

=head1 APPLICABLE SYSTEMS

Any system with some automated backup creating or updating archive files.

This works well with backup-manager.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The following example checks all tar.bz2 files in /path/to/your/backups/, and
counts all those that are less than 2 days old, and there should be 4 separate
daily archives.

	[fresh-backups]
	user root
	env.backup_dir /path/to/your/backups/
	env.lifetime 2
	env.archive_pattern *.tar.bz2
	env.backup_number 4
	
This will also set the warning and critical values for this plugin to 2*4 and
4, respectively, meaning that if the number of fresh files goes below those
limits, the relevant notifications will be triggerred.

An example configuration snippet for backup-manager [0] follows.

	export BM_REPOSITORY_ROOT="/path/to/your/backups"
	export BM_TARBALL_FILETYPE="tar.bz2"
	export BM_TARBALL_DIRECTORIES="/etc /home /srv /data"
