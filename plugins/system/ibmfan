# Plugin to monitor fan speed on an IBM/Lenovo Laptop
#
# This plugin reads the current speed of the system fan from
# the /proc file system. As it queries specific files provided
# by kernel modules for IBM/Lenovo Laptops, it probably only 
# works for those, but it should be easy to adapt to others
# if similar information is available for other types of laptops.
