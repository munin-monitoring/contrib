# This plugin monitors ALL processes on a system. No exceptions. It can
# produce very big graphs! But if you want to know which processes are
# killing your system by page faulting, without knowing what to monitor
# in advance, this can help; or in addition to one of the more specific
# plugins to monitor just Apache or MySQL, for example.
#
# Each counter is a DERIVE (difference since the last counter reading)
# of the number of major page faults, usually 4k each, read in by a
# process. Memory mapped files probably contribute to this. The process
# cannot continue until the page fault is served, so this is a
# high-priority read that usually indicates memory starvation.
# Processes with no page faults at all are ignored. Processes
# that die may not appear on the graph, and anyway their last chunk of
# CPU usage before they died is lost. You could modify this plugin to
# read SAR/psacct records if you care about that.
