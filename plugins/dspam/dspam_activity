=head1 NAME

dspam_activity - Plugin to monitor DSPAM message handling activities.

=head1 APPLICABLE SYSTEMS

Any system running a recent (3.8.0 or higher) DSPAM install.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The plugin uses the contents of the SystemLog or UserLog produced by DSPAM.

The following environment variables are used by this plugin:

 logfile - Where to find the system.log that is written by dspam
          (default: /var/spool/dspam/system.log)

=head2 CONFIGURATION EXAMPLES

 [dspam_activity]
  env.logfile /opt/dspam/var/spool/dspam/system.log
  # or when monitoring only a single user in stead of all users:
  env.logfile /var/spool/dspam/data/example.org/username/username.log

=head1 USAGE

Link this plugin to /etc/munin/plugins/ and restart the munin-node.

You'll need to enable system logging in dspam.conf, set 'SystemLog on'
in the DSPAM configuration file.

=head1 INTERPRETATION

The graph shows the messages that DSPAM has processed over the monitored
period, and what kind of action was taken on it. Possible activities are:

 Received messages can be classified as:
 - Innocent (I)
 - Spam (S)
 - Auto-whitelist (W)
 - Virus (V)
 - Blocklist (O)
 - Blacklist (RBL) (A)
 Other actions:
 - Retrained as spam (M)
 - Retrained as innocent (F)
 - Inoculation (N)
 - Corpusfed (C)

Please see DSPAM documentation for more information on used terminology. The
single character in parentheses is the DSPAM internal name for the classifications.
