# This plugin graphs the rate of sent, received, ignored, and dropped
# NTP packets for an ntpd process. Similarly to the if_ plugins,
# received packets are graphed as negative values, and sent packets
# are graphed as positive values. Ignored and dropped packets are
# graphed as positive values.
#
# The values are retrieved using ntpq or ntpdc, depending on the
# version of the NTP distribution.
#
# Symlink this plugin into the node's plugins directory (like
# /etc/munin/plugins).
