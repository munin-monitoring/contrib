#
# Plugin to monitor CPU usage, for a selected set of users
#
# Usage: Place in /etc/munin/plugins/ (or link it there using ln -s)
#	Add this to your /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/munin-node:
#		[cpubyuser]
#		user root # required if /proc can't be read from by any user!
#		env.USERS root yann
#		env.OTHER_FIELD others # enable 'others'-list, set the label/field name
#
#	root and yann being a list of the users to monitor.
#
#	If env.USERS is set to ALL, count all logged in users, and if set to
#	ALLPROC, *all* users with a running process will be listed, except for root.
#
#	You need to also make sure that awk is installed
#
# 2019-08-30 v 1.4 pcy <pcy@ulyssis.org>:
#				- add USERS=ALLPROC, not relying on a tty or pty being present for user detection
#				- OTHERS_FIELD now defaults to disabled, explicitly give it a
#				  value to re-enable it (eg. 'others')
#				- use ps(1) instead of top(1) for easier and more robust
#				  parsing/summary calculation
#
# 2008-12-08 v 1.3.1 Hanisch Elián:
#				- support for dots in user names.
#				- fix labels
#
# 2008-12-01 v 1.3 Hanisch Elián:
#				- fixes, refactoring and code cleanup
#				- Users that use cpu but aren't in the USERS env var
#				are plotted as "others", set others.graph to 'no' if
#				you	don't want this.
#
# 2008-03-20 v 1.2 fireball:	fixed minor screwup, works now ^^
#
# 2008-01-09 v 1.1 fireball:	fixed "-" in usernames, those get replaced by "_" now.
#				set usernames in config accordingly (that is with _)
#
#
# Parameters understood:
#
#	config		(required)
#	autoconf	(optional - used by munin-config)
#
