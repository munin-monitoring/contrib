backups

A tab-delimited ascii table listing information about each successful backup,
one per row. The columns are:

    num
	The backup number, an integer that starts at 0 and increments for each
	successive backup. The corresponding backup is stored in the directory num
	(eg: if this field is 5, then the backup is stored in
	__TOPDIR__/pc/$host/5).

    type
	Set to "full" or "incr" for full or incremental backup.

    startTime
	Start time of the backup in unix seconds.

    endTime
	Stop time of the backup in unix seconds.

    nFiles
	Number of files backed up (as reported by smbclient, tar, rsync or
	ftp).

    size
	Total file size backed up (as reported by smbclient, tar, rsync or
	ftp).

    nFilesExist
	Number of files that were already in the pool (as determined by
	BackupPC_dump and BackupPC_link).

    sizeExist
	Total size of files that were already in the pool (as determined by
	BackupPC_dump and BackupPC_link).

    nFilesNew
	Number of files that were not in the pool (as determined by
	BackupPC_link).

    sizeNew
	Total size of files that were not in the pool (as determined by
	BackupPC_link).

    xferErrs
	Number of errors or warnings from smbclient, tar, rsync or ftp.

    xferBadFile
	Number of errors from smbclient that were bad file errors (zero
	otherwise).

    xferBadShare
	Number of errors from smbclient that were bad share errors (zero
	otherwise).

    tarErrs
	Number of errors from BackupPC_tarExtract.

    compress
	The compression level used on this backup. Zero or empty means no
	compression.

    sizeExistComp
	Total compressed size of files that were already in the pool (as
	determined by BackupPC_dump and BackupPC_link).

    sizeNewComp
	Total compressed size of files that were not in the pool (as determined
	by BackupPC_link).

    noFill
	Set if this backup has not been filled in with the most recent previous
	filled or full backup. See $Conf{IncrFill}.

    fillFromNum
	If this backup was filled (ie: noFill is 0) then this is the number of
	the backup that it was filled from

    mangle
	Set if this backup has mangled file names and attributes. Always true
	for backups in v1.4.0 and above. False for all backups prior to v1.4.0.
