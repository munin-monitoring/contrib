# Plugin to monitor the power state of hard disk drives on FreeBSD.
#
# Configure the plugin to run as root by adding the following to
# /usr/local/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/plugins.conf:
#
# [freebsd_hdd_power_state]
# user root
#
# You can also specify the monitored devices using the 'env.devices'
# environment variable, if autoconfiguration doesn't work for you:
#
# env.devices ada0 ada1 ada2 ada3 ada4 ada5 ada6 ada7
