# The 'byprojects' family
Those plugins are used to monitor different projects or vhost (i.e. either different log files or using regular expression as filters) on the same web server.

## munin_byprojects_access
Count the number of hits per projects/vhost.

## munin_byprojects_bandwidth
Count the total bandwidth used by each projects/vhost. [Logtail] (https://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/logtail/) is required.

## munin_byprojects_inout_bandwidth
Counts the in/out bandwidth used by each projects/vhost. [Logtail] (https://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/logtail/) is required.

## Installation
The setup is pretty straight forward. First you need to configure the plugin:

Define the file which will be used by logtail to identify it's position in the log and the path to logtail:

      $statepath = '/usr/local/var/munin/plugin-state'; # directory where logtail will save the state
      $logtail = '/usr/local/bin/logtail';

Multiple logs can be used for the same project/vhost and a regular expression (regex) can be used as a filter:

      my %logs = (
        'prod' => [
                    {'path' => '/home/prod/log/access.log'}
                  ],
         'dev' => [
                    {'path' => '/var/log/httpd/ssl-dev-access.log'},
                    {'path' => '/home/dev/log/access.log'}
                  ],
        'test' => [
                    {'path' => '/var/log/access.log', 'regex' => '"[A-Z]+ /test/'},
                    {'path' => '/home/test/log/access.log'}
                  ],
      );

In the previous example the prod project graph will be using everything in /home/prod/log/access.log. The test project will be using eveything in /home/test/log/access.log and stuff that match '"[A-Z] /test/' in /var/log/httpd/access.log (e.g. "GET /test/).

Then link the file just as any other plugins.

      ln -s /usr/local/sbin/<plugin> /usr/local/etc/munin/plugins/<plugin>
