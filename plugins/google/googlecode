# Usage:
# Create symbolic link from /etc/munin/plugins/googlecode_projectname to
# /usr/share/munin/plugins/googlecode_
#
# Here, projectname is the name of the project you wish to monitor.
# googlecode_ will look at the downloads list, and list the number
# of downloads for a given file. googlecode_ assumes, that the file
# names take the form "projectname_" or "projectname-", such as
# "sinthgunt_2.0.2_all.deb" for the sinthgunt project hosted at
# www.sinthgunt.org

# Get project name
PROJECTNAME=`basename $0 | sed 's/^googlecode_//g'`

# Get list of files and the number of downloads
declare -a files
