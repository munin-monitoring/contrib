=head1 NAME

mpdstats_ - Munin plugin to monitor a MPD database

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

This plugin uses netcat(1) to communicate with the MPD daemon.

Tip: To see if it is already set up correctly, just run this plugin
with the parameter "autoconf". If you get a "yes", everything should
work like a charm already.

=head1 INSTALLATION

This wildcard plugin should be symlinked using one of these names:
mpdstats_artists, mpdstats_albums, mpdstats_songs

=head1 CONFIGURATION

No configuration should be required if run on the same server as
MPD. If the plugin is run from remote or in a non-default configuration,
please use the environment variables 'mpd_host' and 'mpd_port' to connect.

Also, if your netcat(1) binary is anywhere else than /bin/nc please define
it using the 'netcat' environment variable.

=head2 CONFIGURATION EXAMPLE

 [mpd_*]
  env.mpd_host 192.168.0.43
  env.mpd_port 6606
  env.netcat /usr/local/bin/nc
