These are 2 rather crude munin plugins to get at data about zopes ZODB.
They have proved very useful, together with the process_memory
plugin, in tweaking the zodb cache-size for performance.

There is no config, auto or otherwise, you have to edit the scripts to change anything.
Should not be to hard however :)


To install you have to copy the two scripts in the "scripts_python"
folder into zope. Probably easiest just to paste them into an
appropriately named new script in the ZMI.

Click on the proxy tab, and give them the "Manager" role.

You can test them like this:
wget --delete-after -q -O - localhost:8080/<your path>/munin_db_activity.py
wget --delete-after -q -O - localhost:8080/<your path>/munin_cache_parameters.py

Edit zope_db_activity and zope_cache_parameters scripts to reflect
<your path> and your instance(s) ports. 

Then move them into your munin plugins lib, and create a symlink under etc according to the
usual munin custom:

mv zope_* /opt/munin/lib/plugins/

ln -s /opt/munin/lib/plugins/zope_*  /etc/opt/munin/plugins/

Test them with:
/opt/munin/sbin/munin-run zope_db_activity
/opt/munin/sbin/munin-run zope_cache_parameters

Restart your munin-node and the graphs should appear shortly.

If you make any improvements (which should be easy), please update
