# 20100310  v1.01  ls
#               as threatened, shows now "temperatures" of active hosts.deny lines. Recent additions are 
#               displayed in bright red, turning to blue as older the addition rules are.
#               This requires denyhosts to add line to hosts.deny in a specific format. Also, times are currently
#               hardcoded, and not a lot of flexibility adjusting them through parameters.
#               A line in hosts.deny should come with a comment, looking like:
#               # DenyHosts: Sat Mar  6 01:11:57 2010 | sshd: 87.101.51.198
#               8 graphs are drawn from that depicting number of rules in 24 h increments. Different colours are
#               assigned to graphs which are <24h, 24-48h, 48-72h ... old. The last (coldest) graph shows rules 
#               which have been added > 168h ago.
#               I'm considerering to change age granularity to hours, rather than days, and plot many graphs (64 or 128,
#               which are nice for colour calculations), showing more of a colour cloud than discernible areas. 
#               The plugin must have permission to read /etc/hosts.deny, of course.
# 20100308, v1.0, ls 
#               Will probably add multiple stacked graphs, indicative for addition/removal date of denies,
#               instead of a boring single area graph.
