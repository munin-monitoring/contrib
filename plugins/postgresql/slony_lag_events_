# plugin to monitor difference between st_last_event and st_last_received
# in sl_status table (based on slony_ and slony_lag_)
#
# http://blog.endpoint.com/2009/07/slony-slstatus-and-diagnosing.html
#
# st_origin: the local slony system
# st_received: the slony instance that sent an event
# st_last_event: the sequence number of the last event received from that origin/received pair
# st_last_event_ts: the timestamp on the last event received
# st_last_received: the sequence number of the last sl_event + sl_confirm pair received
# st_last_received_ts: the timestamp on the sl_confirm in that pair
# st_last_received_event_ts: the timestamp on the sl_event in that pair
# st_lag_num_events: difference between st_last_event and st_last_received
# st_lag_time: difference between st_last_event_ts and st_last_received_ts
#

# Configuration variables:
#
#  PGHOST      - Database server to use.
#  PGUSER      - User to connect as.
#  PGPASSWORD  - Password to use.
#  PGSCHEMA    - Replication schema.
#
# Configuration example:
#
# munin-node:

#  env.PGHOST localhost
#  env.PGUSER slony
#  env.PGPASSWORD password
#  env.PGSCHEMA _slony
