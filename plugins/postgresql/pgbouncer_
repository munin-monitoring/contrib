=head1 NAME

pgbouncer_ is a plugin to get the pool and stat values for a single pgbouncer pool name

=head1 APPLICATION

perl and DBD::Pg is required, and pgbouncer must been installed with a correct setup access for a stat account

=head1 CONFIGURATION

the plugin that will be run needs to have the pool name after the plugin base name.
alternatively, pool name can be specified in config file as env.pgbouncer_pool option, separating plugin name from pool name.

=head2 plugin configuration

eg: pgbouncer_foo will run for the pool named foo.

see SHOW POOLS database list for the pool name

=head2 munin plugin config file

in the plugin config file under the [pgbouncer] name the access information ca be set.

eg:
  [pgbouncer*]
    env.pgbouncer_pass barfoo

more extended would be:
  [pgbouncer*]
    env.pgbouncer_pass barfoo
    env.pgbouncer_user bar
    env.pgbouncer_port 6542
    env.pgbouncer_host localhost

another example, where different pgbouncers (and so munin plugins) connecting to same db:
   [pgbouncer_weblogin]
     env.pgbouncer_pass barfoo
     env.pgbouncer_user bar
     env.pgbouncer_port 6542
     env.pgbouncer_host localhost
     env.pgbouncer_pool dbname
    
   [pgbouncer_webmain]
     env.pgbouncer_pass barfoo
     env.pgbouncer_user bar
     env.pgbouncer_port 6543
     env.pgbouncer_host localhost
     env.pgbouncer_pool dbname

The database name is always pgbouncer

=head1 OUTPUT

The plugin will output 5 graphs in the group pgbouncer

=head2 Average bytes received/sent

This graph will show the average bytes sent and received by the pgbouncer for this pool

=head2 Average connections

This graph will show the average amount of connections to the pgbouncer for this pool 

=head2 Average query time

This graph shows the average query time as processed by the pgbouncer for this pool in microseconds. The data will be shorted by standard SI. eg, m = milli, k = kilo.

So 4.61K is 4610 milliseconds

=head2 Client connections

This graph shows the active and waiting client connections to pgbouncer for this pool

=head2 Server connections

This graph shows the server connections to pgbouncer for this pool. The following data sets are shown: active, idle, used, tested, login

=head2 Max wait

how long the oldest client the queue has waited, should be always 0

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Original idea derived from a simple python script by Dimitri Fontaine
