#                  Plugin to monitor basic statistics of EMC VNX 5300 Unified Datamovers                             #

#####################################

# The plugin monitors LUN of EMC Unified Storage FLARE SP's. Probably it can also be compatible with 
# other Clariion systems. It uses SSH to connect to Control Stations, then remotely executes 
# /nas/sbin/navicli and fetches and parses data from it. Obviously, it's easy to reconfigure plugin not to use 
# Control Stations' navicli in favor of using locally installed /opt/Navisphere's cli. There is no difference which
# Storage Processor to use to gather data, so this plugin tries both of them and uses the first active one.
# This plugin also automatically chooses Primary Control Station from the list by calling /nasmcd/sbin/getreason and 
# /nasmcd/sbin/t2slot.
# 
# I left some parts of this plugin as rudimental to make easy to reconfigure it to draw more (or less) data.

#        Configuration              #
#####################################

######### Prerequisites #########

# First of all, be sure that statistics collection is turned on. You can do this by typing:
# navicli -h spa setstats -on
# on your Control Station or locally through /opt/Navisphere 

# Also, the plugin actively uses buggy "cdef" feature of Munin, and here we can be hit by the following bugs:
# http://munin-monitoring.org/ticket/1017 - Here I have some workarounds in plugin, be sure that they are working.
# http://munin-monitoring.org/ticket/1352 - 
# Metrics in my plugin can be much longer than 15 characters, so you have to edit the following file:
# /usr/share/perl5/Munin/Master/GraphOld.pm
# Find get_field_name() function and change "15" to "255".

######### Installation #########

# The plugin uses SSH to connect to Control Stations. It's possible to use 'nasadmin' user, but it would be better
# if you create read-only global user by Unisphere Client. The user should have only Operator role.
# I created "operator" user but due to the fact that Control Stations already had one internal "operator" user,
# the new one was called "operator1". So be careful.
# 
# On munin-node side choose a user which will be used to connect through SSH. Generally user "munin" is ok. Then,
# execute "sudo su munin -s /bin/bash", "ssh-keygen" and "ssh-copy-id" to both Control Stations with newly created 
# user.
# 
# Make a link from /usr/share/munin/plugins/emc_vnx_dm_basic_stats to /etc/munin/plugins/emc_vnx_dm_basic_stats_<NAME>,
# where <NAME> is any arbitrary name of your storage system. The plugin will return <NAME> in its answer 
# as "host_name" field.
# Assume your storage system is called "VNX5300".
# 
# Make a configuration file at /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/emc_vnx_block_lun_perfdata_VNX5300
# 
# [emc_vnx_block_lun_perfdata_VNX5300]
# user munin							# SSH Client local user
# env.username operator1					# Remote user with Operator role
# env.cs_addr 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2				# Control Stations addresses

#           Errata                  #
#####################################
# It counts Queue Length in not fully correct way. We take parameters totally from both SP's, but after we divide them
# independently by load of SPA and SPB. Anyway, in most AAA / ALUA cases the formula is correct.
