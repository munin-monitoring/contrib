# Plugin to monitor packet loss
#
# Please note that sometimes it can take quite long for the plugin to return
# a value on a network with lots of packet loss.
# You therefore need to account for it by appending the following to your
# plugin-conf.d/munin-node. Remember to restart munin-node afterwards.
# Append the next 3 lines to plugin-conf.d/munin-node:
# [packetloss_*]
# timeout 60
# user root
#
# Parameters:
#
# 	ping_args      - Arguments to ping (default "-c 2")
# 	ping_args2     - Arguments after the host name (required for Solaris)
# 	ping           - Ping program to use
# 	host           - Host to ping
#
# Arguments for Solaris:
#      ping_args      -s
#      ping_args2     56 2
