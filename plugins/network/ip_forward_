# Wildcard-plugin to monitor forward traffic for network inretfaces through iptables. To monitor an
# interface, link if_forward_<interface> to this file. E.g.
#
#    ln -s /usr/share/node/node/plugins-auto/if_forward_ /etc/munin/node.d/if_forward_eth0
#
# ...will monitor forwarded traffic trough eth0.
#
# Aditionally, you need these iptables rules as the first rules (they don't do anything, just make packet counts)
#
#    iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0
#    iptables -A FORWARD -o eth0
#
# Furthermore, this plugin needs to be run as root for iptables to work
#
# This plugin is based on the if_ and ip_ plugin.
#
# Magic markers (optional - used by munin-config and some installation
# scripts):
