# Wildcard-plugin to monitor IP addresses through iptables. To monitor an
# IP, link fwbuilder_<ipaddress> to this file. E.g.
#
#    ln -s /usr/share/node/node/plugins-auto/fwbuilder_ /etc/munin/node.d/fwbuilder_192.168.0.1
#
# ...will monitor the IP 192.168.0.1.
#
# Additionally, you need Accountingrules in fwbuilder
#	fwbuilder creates Chains in INPUT-, OUTPUT- and FORWARD-Chain
#	with Rules that "RETURN"
#	You will have to specify rule options with name "ACCOUNTING" for the 
#	rules to use, otherwise no rules will be found.
#	try "fwbuilder_ suggest" to see if all is ok. 
#    
#
# Furthermore, this plugin needs to be run as root for iptables to work
#
# This plugin is based on the if_ plugin.
