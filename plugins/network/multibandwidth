=head1 NAME

multibandwidth - Plugin to monitor the bandwidth between localhost and serveral hosts.

=head1 APPLICABLE SYSTEMS

This plugin is useful when you want to monitor the bandwidth between localhost and multiple hosts in a single graph or in several graphs making different soft links.

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

bing installed.

You can install bing by using (Ubuntu/Debian): apt-get install bing

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The following is the default configuration

[multibandwidth]
user root
env.hosts example.org example2.org example3.org
env.samples 10
env.small_packet_size 1000
env.big_packet_size 8000

- env.hosts explanation: hostname or IP of the hosts to calculate the bandwidth.

- env.samples explanation: Reset stats after sending samples ECHO_REQUEST packets.

- env.small_packet_size explanation: Specifies the number of data bytes to be sent in the small packets. The default and minimum value is 44.

- env.big_packet_size explanation: Specifies the number of data bytes to be sent in the big packets. The default is 108. The size should be chosen so that big packet roundtrip times are long enough to be accurately measured.
