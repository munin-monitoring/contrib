=head1 NAME

loggrepx - Counts the number of matching log lines by log file

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin is somewhat of a bash port of the original loggrep plugin,
except that it displays a breakdown of matches per file, rather than
aggregating matches across all files. It is intended to answer the
question, "Which of my logs are reporting concerning events right now?"

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The plugin can be included multiple times to create graphs for various
differing kinds of information in your log files. For example, you may
want to monitor the occurrence of 5xx errors in your webserver logs, but
also the occurrence of alert|critical|emergency entries in your syslog.

You can accomplish this by linking the plugin twice and providing
different criteria for each instance.

Note that most instances will probably work best when run as root, since
log files are usually (or at least should be) controlled with strict
permissions.

Available config options include the following:

 env.logfiles         - Files to grep (shellglob) (required)
 env.regex            - Regex to look for (required)
 env.title            - Graph title
 env.warning          - Default warning level
 env.critical         - Default critical level
 env.[field]_label    - Label to use for a specific logfile
 env.[field]_warning  - Warning level for specific logfile
 env.[field]_critical - Critical level for specific logfile

NOTE: for any variable with [field] in it, [field] is derived from the
full logfile path by simply removing the preceding slash and replacing
all non-alphanumerics with underscores. For example, the "warning" field
for the logfile F</var/log/nginx/errors.log> would be
F<var_log_nginx_errors_log_warning>.

One good way to get these names is to run C<munin-run [plugin-name]>
after you've configured the required variables and then just copy/paste
the names from the output.
