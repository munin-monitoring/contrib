=head1 DESCRIPTION

service_events - Tracks the number of significant event occurrences per service

This plugin is a riff on the loggrep family (C<loggrep> and my own C<loggrepx_>).
However, rather than focusing on single log files, it focuses on providing
insight into all "significant events" happening for a given service, which
may be found across several log files.

The idea is that any given service may produce events in various areas of
operation. For example, while a typical web app might log runtime errors
to it's app.log file, a filesystem change may prevent the whole app from
even being bootstrapped, and this crucial error may be logged in an apache
log or in syslog.

This plugin attempts to give visibility into all such "important events"
that may affect the proper functioning of a given service. It attempts to
answer the question, "Is my service running normally?".

Unfortunately, it won't help you trace down exactly where the events are
coming from if you happen to be watching a number of different logs, but
it will at least let you know that something is wrong and that action
should be taken. To try to help with this, the plugin uses the extinfo
field to list which logs currently have important events in them.

The plugin can be included multiple times to create graphs for various
differing kinds of services. For example, you may have both webservices
and system cleanup services, and you want to keep an eye on them in
different ways.

You can accomplish this by linking the plugin twice with different names
and providing different configuration for each instance. In general, you
should think of a single instance of this plugin as representing a single
class of services.


=head1 CONFIGURATION

Configuration for this plugin is admittedly complicated. What we're doing
here is defining groups of logfiles that we're searching for various
kinds of events. It is assumed that the _way_ we search for events in the
logfiles is related to the type of logfile; thus, we associate match
criteria with logfile groups. Then, we define services that we want to
track, then mappings of logfile paths to those services.

(Note that most instances will probably work best when run as root, since
log files are usually (or at least should be) controlled with strict
permissions.)

Available config options include the following:

 Plugin-specific:

 env.<type>_logfiles      - (reqd) Shell glob pattern defining logfiles of
                            type <type>
 env.<type>_regex         - (reqd) egrep pattern for finding events in logs
                            of type <type>
 env.services             - (optl) Space-separated list of service names
 env.services_autoconf    - (optl) Shell glob pattern that expands to paths
                            whose final member is the name of a service
 env.<service>_logbinding - (optl) egrep pattern for binding <service> to
                            a given set of logfiles (based on path)
 env.<service>_warning    - (optl) service-specific warning level override
 env.<service>_critical   - (optl) service-specific critical level override

 Munin-standard:

 env.title                - Graph title
 env.vlabel               - Custom label for the vertical axis
 env.warning              - Default warning level
 env.critical             - Default critical level

For plugin-specific options, the following rules apply:

* C<< <type> >> is any arbitrary string. It just has to match between
  C<< <type>_logfiles >> and C<< <type>_regex >>. Common values are "apache",
  "nginx", "apt", "syslog", etc.
* <service> is a string derived by passing the service name through a filter
  that removes non-alphabet characters from the beginning and replaces all non-
  alpha-numeric characters with underscore (C<_>).
* logfiles are bound to services by matching C<< <service>_logbinding >> on the
  full logfile path. For example, specifying C<my_site_logbinding=my-site> would
  bind both F</var/log/my-site/errors.log> and F</srv/www/my-site/logs/app.log>
  to the defined C<my-site> service.


=head2 SERVICE AUTOCONF

Because services are often dynamic and you don't want to have to manually update
config every time you deploy a new service, you have the option of defining a
glob pattern that resolves to a collection of paths whose endpoints are service
names. Because of the way services are deployed in real life, it's fairly common
that paths will exist on your system that can accommodate this. Most often it
will be something like /srv/*/*, which would match all children in /srv/www/ and
/srv/local/.

If you choose not to use the autoconf feature, you MUST specify services as a
space-separated list of service names in the C<services> variable.


=head2 EXAMPLE CONFIGS

This example uses services autoconf:

	[service_events]
	user root
	env.services_autoconf /srv/*/*
	env.cfxsvc_logfiles /srv/*/*/logs/app.log
	env.cfxsvc_regex error|alert|crit|emerg
	env.phpfpm_logfiles /srv/*/*/logs/php-fpm*.log
	env.phpfpm_regex Fatal error
	env.apache_logfiles /srv/*/*/logs/errors.log
	env.apache_regex error|alert|crit|emerg
	env.warning 1
	env.critical 5
	env.my_special_service_warning 100
	env.my_special_service_critical 300

This example DOESN'T use services autoconf:

	[service_events]
	user root
	env.services auth.example.com admin.example.com www.example.com
    env.auth_example_com_logbinding my-custom-binding[0-9]+
	env.cfxsvc_logfiles /srv/*/*/logs/app.log
	env.cfxsvc_regex error|alert|crit|emerg
	env.phpfpm_logfiles /srv/*/*/logs/php-fpm*.log
	env.phpfpm_regex Fatal error
	env.apache_logfiles /srv/*/*/logs/errors.log
	env.apache_regex error|alert|crit|emerg
	env.warning 1
	env.critical 5
	env.auth_example_com_warning 100
	env.auth_example_com_critical 300
	env.www_example_com_warning 50
	env.www_example_com_critical 100

This graph will ONLY ever show values for the three listed services, even
if other services are installed whose logfiles match the logfiles search.

Also notice that in this example, we've only listed a log binding for the
auth service. The plugin will use the service name by default for any
services that don't specify a log binding, so in this case, auth has a
custom log binding, while all other services have log bindings equal to
their names.
