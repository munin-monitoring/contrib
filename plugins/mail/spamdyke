# Plugin to monitor spamdyke
#
#    Spamdyke logs expected to be inside /var/log/mail.info
#    logtail must be installed 
#    Plugin state stored in /var/lib/munin/plugin-state
#      (statedir as defined in munin debian packages)
# 
#    You may override spamdyke logfile in plugin-conf.d/munin-node, and
#    give the user/group with enough rights to read your logs (group
#    adm on stock debian works fine)
#
#    [spamdyke]
#    env.logfile /var/log/maillog

# Parameters understood:

# 	config   (required)
# 	autoconf (optional)
